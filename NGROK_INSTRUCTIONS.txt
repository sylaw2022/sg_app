HOSTING LOCALLY WITH NGROK - INSTRUCTIONS FOR README.docx
================================================================================

## Hosting Locally and Accessing via Internet with ngrok

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- ngrok installed (download from https://ngrok.com/)

### Method 1: Using the Automated Script

1. Make sure the script is executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x start-ngrok.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./start-ngrok.sh
   ```

3. The script will:
   - Start the Next.js development server on port 3000
   - Wait for the server to be ready
   - Start ngrok tunnel automatically
   - Display the public ngrok URL

4. Access your app:
   - Local: http://localhost:3000
   - Public: Check the ngrok URL displayed in the terminal (e.g., https://xxxxx.ngrok-free.dev)
   - Note: On first visit, ngrok free tier shows a warning page - click "Visit Site" to continue

5. View ngrok dashboard:
   - Open http://localhost:4040 in your browser to see request logs

6. To stop:
   - Press Ctrl+C in the terminal

### Method 2: Manual Steps

1. Start the Next.js development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The server will run on http://localhost:3000

2. In a new terminal, start ngrok:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

3. Copy the public URL from ngrok output (e.g., https://xxxxx.ngrok-free.dev)

4. Access your app from anywhere using the ngrok URL

5. View ngrok dashboard at http://localhost:4040

### Troubleshooting

- If port 3000 is already in use, change the port in package.json or use: `npm run dev -- -p 3001`
- If ngrok is not found, make sure it's installed and in your PATH
- The ngrok URL changes each time you restart ngrok (unless you have a paid plan with a static domain)
